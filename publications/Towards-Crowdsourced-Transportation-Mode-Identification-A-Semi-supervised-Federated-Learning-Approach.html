Yu*<br>IEEE Internet of Things Journal, Volume 9, Issue 14, Jul. 2022, Pages 11868-11882</h4></div><p>Privacy-preserving Transportation Mode Identification (TMI) is among the key challenges towards future intelligent transportation systems. With recent developments in federated learning (FL), crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising cost-effective data source for training powerful TMI classifiers without compromising users&#39; data privacy. However, existing TMI approaches have relied heavily on the availability of transportation mode labels, which is often limited in real-world applications. While recent semi-supervised studies have partially addressed this issue by assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, such practice often degrades classification performance as more unlabeled data are incorporated. In response to this issue, we present a semi-supervised FL scheme for TMI termed Mean Teacher Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (MTSSFL). MTSSFL trains a deep neural network ensemble under a novel semi-supervised FL framework, achieving highly accurate and privacy-protected crowdsourced TMI without depending on the availability of massive labeled data. MTSSFL introduces consistency-updating to insert the global model in the gradient updates of the local models that only have unlabeled data to improve their training. We also devise mean-teacher-averaging, a secure parameter aggregation mechanism that further boosts the global model&#39;s TMI performance without requiring additional training. Our extensive case studies on a real-world dataset demonstrate that MTSSFL&#39;s classification accuracy is merely 1.1% lower than the state-of-the-art semi-supervised TMI approach while being the only one to satisfy FL&#39;s privacy-preserving constraints. In addition, MTSSFL can achieve high accuracy with less training overhead due to the proposed semi-supervised learning design.</p><div class="centered"><h4><a href="http://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~james/files/publications/Towards-Crowdsourced-Transportation-Mode-Identification-A-Semi-supervised-Federated-Learning-Approach.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a></h4><h4><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9632695" target="_blank">Digital Library</a></h4><h4><a href="javascript:copy()">Copy Citation</a></h4><script>let citation = `Chenhan Zhang, Yuanshao Zhu, Christos Markos, Shui Yu, and James J.Q.
