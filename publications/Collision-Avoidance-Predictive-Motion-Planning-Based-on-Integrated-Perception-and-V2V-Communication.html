Yu*, and Miaowen Wen<br>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, in press</h4></div><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs), as one of the cores in future intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), can facilitate reliable and safe traffic operations and services. The ability to automatically perform effective AV motion planning and deploy efficient perception systems is vital for advancing the quality of core transportation services. However, existing research studies have only considered the applications of either of these approaches, which neglect their necessary interactions in real-world AV motion planning systems. To address this problem, we design an AV motion planning strategy based on motion prediction and V2V communication. Specifically, we propose the perception system and V2V communication module to provide real-time traffic and vehicular information to the participated AVs. Then, we formulate the AV lane-change motion planning problem through the scope of model predictive control based problem, as well as proposing the method on learning optimal motion planning by means of a novel deep learning technique. We conduct extensive case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed system model. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system model under various traffic conditions. In addition, the robustness of the perception system is guaranteed by utilizing the Car Learning to Act (CARLA) system with available V2V communication.</p><div class="centered"><h4><a href="http://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~james/files/publications/Collision-Avoidance-Predictive-Motion-Planning-Based-on-Integrated-Perception-and-V2V-Communication.pdf" target="_blank">Download PDF</a></h4><h4><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9750060" target="_blank">Digital Library</a></h4><h4><a href="javascript:copy()">Copy Citation</a></h4><script>let citation = `Shiyao Zhang, Shuai Wang, Shuai Yu, James J.Q.
